# colorpallete
A simple color picker :)

I made this to turn on more easy the job. On ghpages you can acess the program, [https://pablorodrigo52.github.io/colorpallete/](https://pablorodrigo52.github.io/colorpallete/).

I'm building this with React and trainning _components_, _state_ and _props_.

## Techs (until now)
- React
- gh-pages 

## Functions
- Switch between colors;             OK
- Copy to clipboard some color;      OK
- Select and remain fixed one color;
- Slider to lightness;
- Slider to saturation;
